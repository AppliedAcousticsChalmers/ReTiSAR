* __v2020.10.21__
  * Improvement of establishing _JACK_ and/or OS specific client name length limitation of `JackClient`
* __v2020.10.15__ ([__v2020.FA__](https://github.com/AppliedAcousticsChalmers/ReTiSAR/releases/tag/v2020.FA))

* __v2020.9.10__
  * Enforcement of `Black >= 20.8b1` code style
* __v2020.8.20__
  * Extension of `JackPlayer` to make autoplay behaviour configurable (via `config` parameter or command line argument)
* __v2020.8.13__
  * Update of OSC Remote Demo to reset (after not receiving data) and clip displayed RMS values
  * Improvement of FFTW wisdom verification to be more error proof
* __v2020.7.16__
  * Addition of experimental `SECTORIAL_DEGREE_SELECTION` and `EQUATORIAL_DEGREE_SELECTION` SH weighting techniques (partial elimination of HRIR elevation queues)
  * Update of plotting during and after application of SH compensation techniques
* __v2020.7.7__
  * Addition of HRIR and HPCF source files to _SADIE II_ database [[8]](README.md#references)
  * Extension of `DataRetriever` to automatically extract requested resources from downloaded `*.zip` archives
* __v2020.7.4__
  * Introduction of FFTW wisdom file signature verification (in order to update any already accumulated wisdom run with `--PYFFTW_LEGACY_FILE=log/pyfftw_wisdom.bin` once)
  * Fixes for further SonarLint security and code style recommendations
* __v2020.7.1__
  * Update and addition of further _WDR Cologne_ ARIR source files (linking to Zenodo data set)
  * Hack for Modal Radial Filters generation in open / cardioid SMA configurations (unfortunately this metadata is not directly available in the SOFA ARIR files)
* __v2020.4.8__
  * Improvement of IIR pink noise generation (continuous utilization of internal filter delay conditions)
  * Improvement of IIR pink noise generation (employment of SOS instead of BA coefficients)
  * Addition of IIR _Eigenmike_ coloration noise generation according to [[10]](README.md#references)
* __v2020.4.3__
  * Improvement of white noise generation (vastly improved performance due to `numpy SFC64` generator)
  * Enabling of `JackGenerator` (and derivatives) to operate in single precision for improved performance
* __v2020.3.3__
  * Addition of further simulated array data sets
